# Space Shooters
Space Shooters is a roguelite game I created in Unity using C#. This project served as the primary assessment for the game development module ([CSC384](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=any&mod=CSC384&ayr=24%2F25&psl=TB2&detailOnly=false&_gl=1*gy9nk*_gcl_au*NTc0NzkzODg5LjE3MTY4ODY5NzI.)) during my third year at Swansea University. 
Throughout the development process, I implemented key game design patterns essential for developing high-quality games. These included the [state pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html) and [type object pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/type-object.html).

Overall the project achieved an 84% grade.

## Playing the Game
The game can be run on Windows machines by running the _.exe_ in the [builds](/Builds) folder. The full source can also be loaded into the Unity editor and rebuilt or edited.
