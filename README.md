# Space Shooters
Space Shooters is an immersive game I created in Unity using C#. This project served as the primary assessment for the game development module during my third year at Swansea University. 
Throughout the development process, I implemented key game design patterns essential for developing high-quality games. These included the [state pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html) and [type object pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/type-object.html).
